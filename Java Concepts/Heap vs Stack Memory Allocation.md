In Java, memory management is a vital process. It is managed by Java automatically. The JVM divides the memory into two parts: stack memory and heap memory. From the perspective of Java, both are important memory areas but both are used for different purposes. The major difference between Stack memory and heap memory is that the stack is used to store the order of method execution and local variables while the heap memory stores the objects and it uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. In this section, we will discuss the differences between stack and heap in detail.
