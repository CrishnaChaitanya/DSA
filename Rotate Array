This is a good question
This has 3 approaches:
  -Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
  -Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


// Approach 1: This is easiest approach; we use the mod operator; O(n) TC and O(n) SC

Note- Here i have copied 'nums' array into 'arr' becuz if u perform the operations on arr and copy the answer into nums array the address gets changed and leetcode wont accpt that.
      So we copied the contents of nums and did the operations in nums array using the 'arr' to get the values.
      
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) arr[i] = nums[i];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) nums[(i+k)%n]=arr[i];
    }
}
